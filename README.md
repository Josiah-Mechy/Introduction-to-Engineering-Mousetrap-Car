# Introduction-to-Engineering-Mousetrap-Car
This project involved designing and building a mousetrap-powered car as part of the Intro to Engineering course. The car uses the mechanical energy stored in a mousetrap spring to propel itself forward. The goal was to optimize distance traveled and speed by experimenting with wheel size, axle design, and friction reduction.
