# Introduction-to-Engineering-Mousetrap-Car
## Overview
This project involved designing and building a mousetrap-powered car for the Introduction to Engineering course. The car harnesses the mechanical energy stored in a mousetrap spring to propel itself forward. The primary goal was to optimize both distance traveled and speed by experimenting with variables such as wheel size, axle design, and friction reduction. The design process was constrained by specific parameters and the use of a supplied mousetrap as the power source. The final design successfully traveled 14 meters, demonstrating effective optimization of distance and speed.


## My Contributions
-Designed the chassis and optimized wheel placement to maximize stability.
-Selected materials to ensure a lightweight yet durable construction.
-Implemented a braking system utilizing a wingnut and screw axle mechanism.
-Served as the team lead, coordinating efforts and guiding project development.

## Team Member Contributions
-Brock Ranney — Assisted with CAD design and testing.
-Job Summers and Daniel Porter — Assisted with assembly and testing.

## What I Learned
- Fundamentals of mechanical energy and energy conversion.
- Importance of friction and weight distribution in vehicle performance.
